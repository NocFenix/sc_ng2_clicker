# sc_ng2_clicker
An Angular2 Clicker style website based off the Zerg from Blizzard's StarCraft series

This project is more of a part-time learning experience of my own. I am using it to work in and learn more of the Angular2 framework, and to of course have fun while I do it.

Prerequistes:
* `npm/node.js` which can be found here: `https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm`

Running for the first time:
* Download/Clone the Repo
* Open Terminal/Command Prompt
* Navigate to the Repo
* Enter: `npm install`
* When finished enter: `npm start`
* The website should launch in the default browser
